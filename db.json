      "text": "<p>Hey, thanks for stopping by. Paper Drip is just a funky little website built by a single guy who loves origami. It originally came about as a coding project, but it ended up really reconnecting me with a hobby I've loved since childhood. Here, I post little blurbs on the blog section with cool new techniques or origami discoveries. I plan on sharing a few models I've designed as well, starting with a <strong>gridless</strong> angled rose, definitely inspired by Toshikazu Kawasaki's model. It's a one-person show, so I'm really flattered you checked this out, let alone clicked on and actually read this welcome article!</p><img class=\"article-image\" src=\"http://localhost:3443/media/images/blog.png\" alt=\"A bundle of gridless roses in various red colors\"><p> If you're new here, feel free to register for an account!
